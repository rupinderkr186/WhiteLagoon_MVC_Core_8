# Architectural and Design Patterns in the Project

Based on the provided sources and our conversation history, the project utilizes several key architectural and design patterns. Below are the patterns discussed, along with explanations and any mentioned alternatives.

---

## Clean Architecture

**What it is:**  
Clean Architecture promotes separation of concern by organizing an application into multiple circular layers where dependencies point inward. The layers are:

- **Domain Layer**: Core entities and models for database tables.
- **Application Layer**: Business logic and interfaces (e.g., repository interfaces).
- **Infrastructure Layer**: External concerns such as databases, services, and repository implementations.
- **Presentation Layer**: The user interface layer (e.g., web application with controllers and views).

**Why it's used:**  
The course builds a .NET Core MVC application using Clean Architecture to simplify learning and manage complexity in large applications.

**Alternatives:**  
N-Tier architecture is another common structure but differs in its approach to dependencies and separation.

## MVC (Model-View-Controller) Architecture

**What it is:**

- **Model**: Data representation (e.g., C# classes mapped to DB tables).
- **View**: UI elements rendered to the user.
- **Controller**: Handles user input and connects the model and view.

**Why it's used:**  
MVC provides a clear separation of concerns and was introduced to overcome the limitations of Web Forms.

**Alternatives:**  
Web Forms (older ASP.NET model).

## Dependency Injection (DI)

**What it is:**  
DI is a pattern where classes receive their dependencies from an external source (like a container) rather than creating them internally.

**Why it's used:**  
It promotes loose coupling, makes code testable, avoids duplicate object creation logic, and simplifies future changes.

**Alternatives:**  
Direct instantiation of dependencies within classes, leading to tight coupling and repetitive code.

---

## Repository Pattern

**What it is:**  
Abstracts data access logic through repository classes (e.g., `VillaRepository`) and interfaces. A Generic Repository handles reusable CRUD operations for different entities.

**Why it's used:**  
Encapsulates database operations and moves them out of controllers. Promotes reuse and separation of concerns.

**Alternatives:**  
Direct use of `ApplicationDbContext` within controllers.

---

## Unit of Work Pattern

**What it is:**  
Acts as a wrapper around repositories and provides a single point to save all changes in a transaction-safe manner (e.g., `_unitOfWork.Save()`).

**Why it's used:**  
Reduces clutter by avoiding injecting multiple repositories into controllers and ensures all related DB operations are committed or rolled back together.

**Alternatives:**  
Injecting multiple repositories individually and using separate save methods.

---

## Partial View

**What it is:**  
Reusable view components rendered inside other views. Named with an underscore (e.g., `_Layout.cshtml`).

**Why it's used:**  
Reduces code duplication and simplifies the UI by encapsulating repeated elements.

**Alternatives:**  
Manually duplicating HTML across views (less efficient and harder to maintain).

---

These patterns are employed throughout the project to structure the application, manage dependencies, handle data access, and organize the user interface according to the principles of Clean Architecture and MVC.
