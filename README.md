## Clean Architecture
### Some points for Clean Architecture
  1. One of the most commonly used **`architectural pattern`**
  2. It is a design pattern that **promotes separation of concern** by splitting one large application into **multiple layers** in a **circular design** each layer here will have its own responsibility and their dependencies
  3. **Inward Dependency**: Fundamental behind clean architecture is to create a layer design where **central core of the application is independent of any external dependency** when we have multiple circular layer the dependencies will always Point inward so a layer in clean architecture cannot have outward dependency it must always be an inward.
