## Clean Architecture
### Some points for Clean Architecture
  1. One of the most commonly used **`architectural pattern`**
  2. It is a design pattern that **promotes separation of concern** by splitting one large application into **multiple layers** in a **circular design** each layer here will have its own responsibility and their dependencies
  3. **Inward Dependency**: Fundamental behind clean architecture is to create a layer design where **central core of the application is independent of any external dependency** when we have multiple circular layer the dependencies will always Point inward so a layer in clean architecture cannot have outward dependency it must always be an inward.

### Understanding `<ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>` in .NET Core MVC Projects

#### üìò What Is It?

The setting:

```xml
<ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
```

in a `.NET 6+` project `.csproj` file enables **implicit global using directives**, making common namespaces available automatically without needing explicit `using` statements in each file.

---

#### ‚úÖ What Does It Do?

When enabled, the .NET SDK **automatically includes frequently used namespaces** globally for your project. This helps to reduce repetitive boilerplate in each `.cs` file.

---

#### üì¶ Typical Implicit Usings in ASP.NET Core (MVC)

For projects using the `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web` SDK (e.g., ASP.NET Core MVC apps), the following namespaces are commonly included implicitly:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
```

The actual list may vary depending on the project type and SDK version.

---

#### üìÇ How to View Implicit Usings

To see what namespaces are included automatically, open:

```
obj/Debug/net6.0/YourProject.GlobalUsings.g.cs
```

This auto-generated file contains all the injected global `using` statements.

---

#### ‚öôÔ∏è How to Enable or Disable

##### Enable

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
</PropertyGroup>
```

##### Disable

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <ImplicitUsings>disable</ImplicitUsings>
</PropertyGroup>
```

Or omit the property entirely to use the SDK's default behavior.

---

#### üí° Related Setting: `<Nullable>enable</Nullable>`

This setting enables **nullable reference types** for improved null-safety:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
</PropertyGroup>
```

---

#### ‚úÖ Benefits of Implicit Usings

- ‚úÇÔ∏è Less boilerplate
- üßº Cleaner code files
- üöÄ Faster development

---

#### ‚ùì When to Avoid It

- When you want **full control** over all `using` directives
- In projects with **strict code standards or analysis rules**

---

#### üìé Conclusion

Using `<ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>` simplifies .NET development by reducing redundant `using` directives. It's especially helpful in ASP.NET Core and console apps using .NET 6 and newer.

## launchSetting.json(inside Properties)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edb5af2f-5d3d-479b-a775-c1fdf8403e06)


### Explanation of `launchSettings.json` in ASP.NET Core

The file shown is `launchSettings.json`, a configuration file used by .NET projects (typically ASP.NET Core) to define how the application should be launched during development.

This file resides in the `Properties` folder of a .NET project and is **not used in production** ‚Äî it only affects how the project runs locally in development environments using Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or the `dotnet` CLI.

---

### Breakdown of the File

#### 1. `$schema`
```json
"$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/launchsettings.json"
```
- This is a schema reference for validation and IntelliSense in supporting editors like Visual Studio.

---

#### 2. `profiles`
This section defines **how different environments or servers launch the app**. Here, there are two profiles: `http` and `https`.

---

### Profile: `http`
```json
"http": {
  "commandName": "Project",
  "dotnetRunMessages": true,
  "launchBrowser": true,
  "applicationUrl": "http://localhost:5276",
  "environmentVariables": {
    "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
  }
}
```

- **`commandName`**: `"Project"` tells Visual Studio to run the project as defined.
- **`dotnetRunMessages`**: `true` enables logging messages like "Now listening on...".
- **`launchBrowser`**: `true` automatically opens your default browser when the app runs.
- **`applicationUrl`**: Specifies the base URL used to host the app (HTTP only here).
- **`environmentVariables`**: Sets environment variables, like `"ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"` ‚Äî important for loading the correct `appsettings.{env}.json`.

---

### Profile: `https`
```json
"https": {
  "commandName": "Project",
  "dotnetRunMessages": true,
  "launchBrowser": true,
  "applicationUrl": "https://localhost:7278;http://localhost:5276",
  "environmentVariables": {
    "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
  }
}
```

- Same properties as the HTTP profile, but:
- **`applicationUrl`** includes both HTTPS (`7278`) and HTTP (`5276`) bindings.
- This setup is useful for apps that serve both secure and insecure traffic in development.

---

### Summary

- This file controls **local development startup settings** for an ASP.NET Core app.
- It can define multiple **profiles** (e.g., different ports, environments).
- Commonly used to:
  - Set launch URLs
  - Automatically open a browser
  - Define environment (Development, Staging, Production)

## Program.cs file
### Understanding `Program.cs` in ASP.NET Core MVC

#### üéØ What Is `Program.cs`?

In an **ASP.NET Core MVC** project, `Program.cs` is the **main entry point**. It configures and starts the **web host**, sets up the services, and defines the **HTTP request pipeline**.

---

#### üß† Key Responsibilities

- üé¨ Acts as the application's starting point  
- üõ†Ô∏è Builds and configures the web host  
- üîß Registers services (dependency injection)  
- üåê Configures middleware and routing  
- üöÄ Launches the application  

---

#### ‚úÖ Example: `Program.cs` in .NET 6+ (Minimal Hosting Model)

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add services to the container
builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews();
builder.Services.AddRazorPages();
// builder.Services.AddDbContext<YourDbContext>();

var app = builder.Build();

// Configure the HTTP request pipeline
if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
    app.UseHsts();
}

app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.UseStaticFiles();

app.UseRouting();

app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();

app.MapControllerRoute(
    name: "default",
    pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");

app.Run();
```
#### üß± Components Explained

| Code                          | Purpose                                      |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `CreateBuilder(args)`        | Initializes host with defaults               |
| `builder.Services.Add...`    | Adds services to the DI container            |
| `app.Use...`                 | Adds middleware to the HTTP pipeline         |
| `app.MapControllerRoute(...)`| Configures MVC routing                       |
| `app.Run()`                  | Starts listening for incoming requests       |

---

#### üîÑ Pre-.NET 6: `Startup.cs` Model

Before .NET 6, apps used both:

- `Program.cs`: Host setup  
- `Startup.cs`: Service and middleware configuration  

Now in .NET 6+, everything is combined in `Program.cs` for simplicity.

---

#### ‚úÖ Benefits of New `Program.cs`

- üßº Cleaner and more concise  
- üöÄ Simplifies bootstrapping  
- üì¶ All configuration in one place  
- üîÑ Easier to understand and maintain  

---

## üìù Summary

The `Program.cs` file in ASP.NET Core is where your app starts. In .NET 6 and later, it uses the **minimal hosting model** to streamline app setup, service registration, and middleware configuration into a single file.

## Shared Folder(Views)
**Understanding `Views/Shared` Folder in ASP.NET Core MVC**

### üìÅ Purpose of `Views/Shared`

The `Views/Shared` folder in an ASP.NET Core MVC project is used to store **reusable UI components** and views that are shared across multiple controllers. It helps maintain consistency and avoid duplication in your application's UI.

---

### üìÇ Common Files in `Views/Shared`

| File Name                       | Purpose |
|----------------------------------|---------|
| **_Layout.cshtml**              | Defines the common HTML structure used across all views (master page). |
| **_ViewStart.cshtml**           | Executed before every view; typically used to set the layout. |
| **_ViewImports.cshtml**         | Imports namespaces, tag helpers, and directives globally for views. |
| **_ValidationScriptsPartial.cshtml** | Contains validation scripts like jQuery validation. |
| **Error.cshtml**                | Displays generic error messages when exceptions occur. |
| **Partial Views (e.g., _Navbar.cshtml)** | Reusable UI fragments like headers, footers, navbars, etc. |

---

### üìå Example: `_Layout.cshtml`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>@ViewData["Title"] - MyApp</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="~/css/site.css" />
</head>
<body>
    <header>@Html.Partial("_Navbar")</header>
    <main role="main" class="container">
        @RenderBody()
    </main>
    <footer>@Html.Partial("_Footer")</footer>
    <script src="~/js/site.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

---

### ‚úÖ Benefits

- ‚ôªÔ∏è **Reusability** ‚Äî Create once, use everywhere  
- üßº **Cleaner Code** ‚Äî Reduce redundancy across views  
- üé® **Consistency** ‚Äî Centralize layout and UI behavior  
- üõ†Ô∏è **Maintainability** ‚Äî Easier updates to common UI parts  

---

### üìù Summary

The `Views/Shared` folder is a key part of the MVC pattern in ASP.NET Core. It enables you to manage common layout files and partial views in a single location, supporting maintainable and scalable applications.

### Why `_` (Underscore) Is Used in Shared View Filenames in ASP.NET Core MVC

In ASP.NET Core MVC, filenames like `_Layout.cshtml`, `_ViewStart.cshtml`, or `_PartialView.cshtml` commonly use a **leading underscore (`_`)** by convention. This practice has specific reasons and benefits.

---

#### ‚úÖ Purpose of Using `_` in Filenames

##### 1. üåÄ Indicates Reusability

The underscore signals that the file is **not a standalone view**, but a **shared or reusable component**.

Examples:
- `_Layout.cshtml`: Shared layout file used across views.
- `_Navbar.cshtml`: Partial view used for navigation.

---

##### 2. üõ° Prevents Routing Conflicts

ASP.NET Core MVC **ignores files starting with `_`** when mapping routes from controller actions.

- Prevents unintended rendering of partial views like `_Partial.cshtml` when navigating to `/Home/_Partial`.

---

##### 3. üßπ Improves Code Organization

The naming convention provides **immediate context** to developers.

- It‚Äôs clear `_Header.cshtml` or `_Footer.cshtml` are **partial views**, not full pages.
- Enhances maintainability and consistency.

---

#### üìå Common Examples

| File Name                       | Purpose                                           |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `_Layout.cshtml`                | Main layout page (used via `@Layout`)             |
| `_ViewStart.cshtml`             | Sets the layout and runs before every view        |
| `_ViewImports.cshtml`           | Imports namespaces and tag helpers globally       |
| `_PartialView.cshtml`           | Reusable section rendered in other views          |
| `_ValidationScriptsPartial.cshtml` | Holds common JavaScript for client validation   |

---

#### üìù Summary

The underscore (`_`) prefix is a **convention** used to:

- ‚ôª Mark reusable or **`partial views`**
- üö´ Exclude from direct routing
- üß† Improve clarity for developers

It‚Äôs not technically required, but **strongly recommended** for clarity and to follow MVC best practices.
